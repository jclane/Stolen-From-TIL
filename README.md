# Stolen-From-TIL

This scrapes r/todayilearned for the most recent post.  The post will be cleaned up (some), printed to the CLI, tweeted, and then saved to a file.  It will then rest before checking r/til again for a new post.  If the most recent post matches a post in the file it will rest again.  Otherwise--print, tweet, save, and repeat.
